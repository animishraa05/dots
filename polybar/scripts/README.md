# Polybar Scripts - made by ani

This directory contains various scripts that my Polybar modules utilize to display dynamic information. I've written or adapted these scripts to fetch specific data points that aren't directly available through standard Polybar modules, or to customize their output to my liking.

## Scripts included

- `get_wallpaper.sh`: I use this script to retrieve information about my current wallpaper, which can then be displayed or used by other parts of my system.
- `network_speed.sh`: This script helps me monitor my current network upload and download speeds, providing real-time feedback directly on my bar.
- `polybar-xo-currency.py`: I wrote this Python script to fetch and display currency exchange rates, which is useful for me to keep track of specific financial information.
- `pomodoro.sh`: I use this script to manage a simple Pomodoro timer directly from my Polybar, helping me stay focused during work sessions.
- `system_updates.sh`: This script checks for available system updates, alerting me when I need to update my packages.

I've made sure these scripts are executable and provide the output in a format that Polybar can easily consume.
